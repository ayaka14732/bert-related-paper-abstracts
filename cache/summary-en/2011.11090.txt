Duplicate question detection (DQD) is important to increase efficiency of community and automatic question answering systems. Unfortunately, gathering supervised data in a domain is time-consuming and expensive, and our ability to leverage annotations across domains is minimal. In this work, we leverage neural representations and study nearest neighbors for cross-domain generalization in DQD. We first encode question pairs of the source and target domain in a rich representation space and then using a k-nearest neighbour retrieval-based method, we aggregate the neighbors' labels and distances to rank pairs. We observe robust performance of this method in different cross-domain scenarios of StackExchange, Spring and Quora datasets, outperforming cross-entropy classification in multiple cases.
