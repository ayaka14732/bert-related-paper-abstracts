The ability to quickly learn from a small quantity oftraining data widens the range of machine learning applications. In this paper, we propose a data-efficient image captioning model, VisualGPT, which leverages the linguistic knowledge from a large pretrained language model(LM). A crucial challenge is to balance between the use of visual information in the image and prior linguistic knowledge acquired from pretraining. We designed a novel self-resurrecting encoder-decoder attention mechanism to quickly adapt the pretrained LM as the language decoder ona small amount of in-domain training data. The proposed self-resurrecting activation unit produces sparse activations but has reduced susceptibility to zero gradients. We train the proposed model, VisualGPT, on 0.1%, 0.5% and 1% of MSCOCO and Conceptual Captions training data. Under these conditions, we outperform the best baseline model by up to 10.8% CIDEr on MS COCO and upto 5.4% CIDEr on Conceptual Captions. Further, Visual-GPT achieves the state-of-the-art result on IU X-ray, a medical report generation dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that improves data efficiency of image captioning by utilizing LM pretrained on unimodal data.
