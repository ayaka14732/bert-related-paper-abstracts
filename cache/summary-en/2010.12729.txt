We perform an in-depth error analysis of Adversarial NLI (ANLI), a recently introduced large-scale human-and-model-in-the-loop natural language inference dataset collected over multiple rounds. We propose a fine-grained annotation scheme of the different aspects of inference that are responsible for the gold classification labels, and use it to hand-code all three of the ANLI development sets. We use these annotations to answer a variety of interesting questions: which inference types are most common, which models have the highest performance on each reasoning type, and which types are the most challenging for state of-the-art models? We hope that our annotations will enable more fine-grained evaluation of models trained on ANLI, provide us with a deeper understanding of where models fail and succeed, and help us determine how to train better models in future.
