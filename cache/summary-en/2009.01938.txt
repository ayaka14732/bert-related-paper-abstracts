Information Retrieval (IR) is the task of obtaining pieces of data (such as documents or snippets of text) that are relevant to a particular query or need from a large repository of information. While a combination of traditional keyword- and modern BERT-based approaches have been shown to be effective in recent work, there are often nuances in identifying what information is "relevant" to a particular query, which can be difficult to properly capture using these systems. This work introduces the concept of a Multi-Perspective IR system, a novel methodology that combines multiple deep learning and traditional IR models to better predict the relevance of a query-sentence pair, along with a standardized framework for tuning this system. This work is evaluated on the BioASQ Biomedical IR + QA challenges.
