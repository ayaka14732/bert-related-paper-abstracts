Quality of questions and answers from community support websites (e.g. Microsoft Developers Network, Stackoverflow, Github, etc.) is difficult to define and a prediction model of quality questions and answers is even more challenging to implement. Previous works have addressed the question quality models and answer quality models separately using meta-features like number of up-votes, trustworthiness of the person posting the questions or answers, titles of the post, and context naive natural language processing features. However, there is a lack of an integrated question-answer quality model for community question answering websites in the literature. In this brief paper, we tackle the quality Q&A modeling problems from the community support websites using a recently developed deep learning model using bidirectional transformers. We investigate the applicability of transfer learning on Q&A quality modeling using Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) trained on a separate tasks originally using Wikipedia. It is found that a further pre-training of BERT model along with finetuning on the Q&As extracted from Microsoft Developer Network (MSDN) can boost the performance of automated quality prediction to more than 80%. Furthermore, the implementations are carried out for deploying the finetuned model in real-time scenario using AzureML in Azure knowledge base system.
