We applied the T5 sequence-to-sequence model to tackle the AI2 WinoGrande Challenge by decomposing each example into two input text strings, each containing a hypothesis, and using the probabilities assigned to the "entailment" token as a score of the hypothesis. Our first (and only) submission to the official leaderboard yielded 0.7673 AUC on March 13, 2020, which is the best known result at this time and beats the previous state of the art by over five points.
