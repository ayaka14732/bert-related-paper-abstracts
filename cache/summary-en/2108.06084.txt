Recent works have demonstrated great success in training high-capacity autoregressive language models (GPT, GPT-2, GPT-3) on a huge amount of unlabeled text corpus for text generation. Despite showing great results, autoregressive models are facing a growing training instability issue. Our study on GPT-2 models (117M and 1.5B parameters) show that larger model sizes, sequence lengths, batch sizes, and learning rates would lead to lower training stability and increasing divergence risks. To avoid divergence and achieve better generalization performance, one has to train with smaller batch sizes and learning rates, which leads to worse training efficiency and longer training time. To overcome this stability-efficiency dilemma, we present a study of a curriculum learning-based approach, which helps improves the pre-training convergence speed of autoregressive models. More importantly, we find that curriculum learning, as a regularization method, exerts a gradient variance reduction effect and enables to train autoregressive models with much larger batch sizes and learning rates without training instability, further improving the training speed. Our evaluations demonstrate that curriculum learning enables training GPT-2 models with 8x larger batch size and 4x larger learning rate, whereas the baseline approach struggles with training divergence. To achieve the same validation perplexity targets during pre-training, curriculum learning reduces the required number of tokens and wall clock time by up to 61% and 49%, respectively. To achieve the same or better zero-shot WikiText-103/LAMBADA evaluation results at the end of pre-training, curriculum learning reduces the required number of tokens and wall clock time by up to 54% and 70%, respectively.
