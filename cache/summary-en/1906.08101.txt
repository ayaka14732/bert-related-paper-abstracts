Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) has shown marvelous improvements across various NLP tasks. Recently, an upgraded version of BERT has been released with Whole Word Masking (WWM), which mitigate the drawbacks of masking partial WordPiece tokens in pre-training BERT. In this technical report, we adapt whole word masking in Chinese text, that masking the whole word instead of masking Chinese characters, which could bring another challenge in Masked Language Model (MLM) pre-training task. The proposed models are verified on various NLP tasks, across sentence-level to document-level, including machine reading comprehension (CMRC 2018, DRCD, CJRC), natural language inference (XNLI), sentiment classification (ChnSentiCorp), sentence pair matching (LCQMC, BQ Corpus), and document classification (THUCNews). Experimental results on these datasets show that the whole word masking could bring another significant gain. Moreover, we also examine the effectiveness of the Chinese pre-trained models: BERT, ERNIE, BERT-wwm, BERT-wwm-ext, RoBERTa-wwm-ext, and RoBERTa-wwm-ext-large. We release all the pre-trained models: \url{https://github.com/ymcui/Chinese-BERT-wwm
