Recently, prompt-tuning has achieved promising results for certain few-shot classification tasks. The core idea of prompt-tuning is to insert text pieces (i.e., templates) into the input and transform a classification task into a masked language modeling problem. However, for relation extraction, determining an appropriate prompt template requires domain expertise, and it is cumbersome and time-consuming to obtain a suitable label word. Furthermore, there exist abundant semantic knowledge among the entities and relations that cannot be ignored. To this end, we focus on incorporating knowledge into prompt-tuning for relation extraction and propose a knowledge-aware prompt-tuning approach with synergistic optimization (KnowPrompt). Specifically, we inject entity and relation knowledge into prompt construction with learnable virtual template words as well as answer words and synergistically optimize their representation with knowledge constraints. Extensive experimental results on five datasets with standard and low-resource settings demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.
