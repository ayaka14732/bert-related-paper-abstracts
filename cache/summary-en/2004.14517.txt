In this paper, we propose a method to extract bilingual texts automatically from noisy parallel corpora by framing the problem as a token-level span prediction, such as SQuAD-style Reading Comprehension. To extract a span of the target document that is a translation of a given source sentence (span), we use either QANet or multilingual BERT. QANet can be trained for a specific parallel corpus from scratch, while multilingual BERT can utilize pre-trained multilingual representations. For the span prediction method using QANet, we introduce a total optimization method using integer linear programming to achieve consistency in the predicted parallel spans. We conduct a parallel sentence extraction experiment using simulated noisy parallel corpora with two language pairs (En-Fr and En-Ja) and find that the proposed method using QANet achieves significantly better accuracy than a baseline method using two bi-directional RNN encoders, particularly for distant language pairs (En-Ja). We also conduct a sentence alignment experiment using En-Ja newspaper articles and find that the proposed method using multilingual BERT achieves significantly better accuracy than a baseline method using a bilingual dictionary and dynamic programming.
