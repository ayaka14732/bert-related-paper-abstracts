In this paper, we study how the intrinsic nature of pre-training data contributes to the fine-tuned downstream performance. To this end, we pre-train different transformer-based masked language models on several corpora with certain features, and we fine-tune those language models on GLUE benchmarks. We find that models pre-trained on unstructured data beat those trained directly from scratch on downstream tasks. Our results also show that pre-training on structured data does not always make the model acquire ability that can be transferred to natural language downstream tasks. To our great astonishment, we uncover that pre-training on certain non-human language data gives GLUE performance close to performance pre-trained on another non-English language.
