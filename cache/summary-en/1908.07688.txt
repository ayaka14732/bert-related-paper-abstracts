Monolingual data has been demonstrated to be helpful in improving the translation quality of neural machine translation (NMT). The current methods stay at the usage of word-level knowledge, such as generating synthetic parallel data or extracting information from word embedding. In contrast, the power of sentence-level contextual knowledge which is more complex and diverse, playing an important role in natural language generation, has not been fully exploited. In this paper, we propose a novel structure which could leverage monolingual data to acquire sentence-level contextual representations. Then, we design a framework for integrating both source and target sentence-level representations into NMT model to improve the translation quality. Experimental results on Chinese-English, German-English machine translation tasks show that our proposed model achieves improvement over strong Transformer baselines, while experiments on English-Turkish further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the low-resource scenario.
