In this paper, we present a transfer learning system to perform technical domain identification on multilingual text data. We have submitted two runs, one uses the transformer model BERT, and the other uses XLM-ROBERTa with the CNN model for text classification. These models allowed us to identify the domain of the given sentences for the ICON 2020 shared Task, TechDOfication: Technical Domain Identification. Our system ranked the best for the subtasks 1d, 1g for the given TechDOfication dataset.
