In this paper, we focus on data augmentation for the extreme multi-label classification (XMC) problem. One of the most challenging issues of XMC is the long tail label distribution where even strong models suffer from insufficient supervision. To mitigate such label bias, we propose a simple and effective augmentation framework and a new state-of-the-art classifier. Our augmentation framework takes advantage of the pre-trained GPT-2 model to generate label-invariant perturbations of the input texts to augment the existing training data. As a result, it present substantial improvements over baseline models. Our contributions are two-factored: (1) we introduce a new state-of-the-art classifier that uses label attention with RoBERTa and combine it with our augmentation framework for further improvement; (2) we present a broad study on how effective are different augmentation methods in the XMC task.
