For both human readers and pre-trained language models (PrLMs), lexical diversity may lead to confusion and inaccuracy when understanding the underlying semantic meanings of given sentences. By substituting complex words with simple alternatives, lexical simplification (LS) is a recognized method to reduce such lexical diversity, and therefore to improve the understandability of sentences. In this paper, we leverage LS and propose a novel approach which can effectively improve the performance of PrLMs in text classification. A rule-based simplification process is applied to a given sentence. PrLMs are encouraged to predict the real label of the given sentence with auxiliary inputs from the simplified version. Using strong PrLMs (BERT and ELECTRA) as baselines, our approach can still further improve the performance in various text classification tasks.
