The scientific community continues to publish an overwhelming amount of new research related to COVID-19 on a daily basis, leading to much literature without little to no attention. To aid the community in understanding the rapidly flowing array of COVID-19 literature, we propose a novel BERT architecture that provides a brief yet original summarization of lengthy papers. The model continually learns on new data in online fashion while minimizing catastrophic forgetting, thus fitting to the need of the community. Benchmark and manual examination of its performance show that the model provide a sound summary of new scientific literature.
